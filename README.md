Well, hey! 

This is the technical documentation of the tracker I built for the Additional Mathematics velocity graphing coursework. 

A little about me; I am a student, graduated year 2025, that built this app for our group only. It worked well and provided accurate results, so I suggested to make a polished version for permanent use. And here we are. 

This rep contains the user documents, source code and all files related to the project. I intend for this to be open source, and if any programmers wish to make updates, improvements or changes, they are more than welcome to. 

The folder "code" contains the source code and explanation documents; "guide" contains preserved user guides in case they are lost and  "color" contains the blacklist and code used. Take a look and enjoy this peek into a project that I'm very proud of.
