Well, hey! 

This is the technical documentation of the tracker I built for the Additional Mathematics velocity graphing coursework. 

A little about me; I am a student, graduated year 2025, that built this app for our group only. It worked well and provided accurate results, so I suggested to make a polished version for permanent use. And here we are. 

This rep contains the user documents, source code and all files related to the project. I intend for this to be open source, and if any programmers wish to make updates, improvements or changes, they are more than welcome to. 

The folder "code" contains the source code and explanation documents; "guide" contains preserved user guides in case they are lost and  "color" contains the blacklist and code used. Take a look and enjoy this peek into a project that I'm very proud of. 


# What you can do as a programmer 

All projects will become outdated after some time. Here are some things you can do to ensure this stays up to date : 

- Update the list of blacklisted colors.
You may use my inefficient display code or any other tool to sort them. If the school board ever decides to change the location, a new document will have to be created. If possible, change the color blacklist google document displayed on the main tracker too. If any changes are made, whether it be to add colors or update the document, feel free to commit directly to the files in /colors.

- Update the troubleshooting guide.
The code I've written for the tracker is questionable at best. If any classmates are having issues, you can look at the source code and try to help them troubleshoot. Add guidance to the troubleshooting document, and make the necessary updates if you find anything.

- Update the source code.
If you have the confidence and have found something you want to fix, be my guest. However, be careful not to overwrite or be hasty, create your own google script first, and if you do decide to commit, create a new file named with the date. Refer to the text file in the "code" folder for more information on this.

- Update the GitHub.
This is my first time using git. If you have official naming conventions or better organization systems, given that you proceed with caution, feel free to improve the current system. My only request is that you avoid changing or deleting all current text and add on instead. Preserve this little bit of me to carry on in the documentation ;)
